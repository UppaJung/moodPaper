\caption{For each of the five experiments we presented abstracts for, we asked respondents two questions to gauge their level of disapproval and concern.  We boldface the percent who responded `no' to these questions as this answer indicates disapproval or concern.  Note that we exclude from these tables those respondents who reported being aware of Facebook's study.}
