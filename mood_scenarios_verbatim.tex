\begin{itemize}
\item To increase the proportion of positive posts in some users' news feeds, the researchers will randomly exclude some fraction of friends' negative posts each time the news feed is loaded.
\item To increase the proportion of negative posts in some users' news feeds, the researchers will randomly exclude some fraction of friends' positive posts each time the news feed is loaded.
\item The researchers will use an automated algorithm to measure whether users' posts are of a positive or negative mood.
\item The researchers will publish the anonymized aggregate results of the experiment in a scientific paper.
\item Participants will not be identified and will remain anonymous.
\end{itemize}
If the researchers are not allowed to perform this experiment, they will not be able to make a valid scientific determination of whether users' moods are affected by the moods of their friends' posts. Therefore, the researchers will not be able to produce features that might protect the moods of psychologically-vulnerable users.
