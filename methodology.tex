In this survey, you will be ask you about five hypothetical scientific experiments.  For each, we will ask you to:

\begin{packed_itemize}
\item \textit{Carefully} read an abstract description of the experiment (350 words or fewer).
\item Answer 4 multiple-choice questions about each experiment.
\item Optionally provide short explanations of your answers.
\end{packed_itemize}
Finally, we will ask you some brief demographic questions at the end of the study.  All personal information (e.g., age) is optional.   Your responses will be kept anonymous, though we reserve the right to copy or quote the responses you provide.

The entire survey should take \textbf{under 10 minutes of your time} and pays \textbf{\$1.00}.

This survey is part of a research project being conducted by \anonymized{the The Ethical Research Project}.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us at: team@ethicalresearch.org

\section{Experimental procedure}
We used a single Human Intelligence Task on Amazon's Mechanical Turk to prevent the same worker account from taking the survey twice (though we cannot guarantee some workers with multiple accounts did not do so).  We restricted workers to those coming from the United States.

After brief instructions, we presented five experimental scenarios in random order (randomized for each participant).  Four of the scenarios were the same for each respondent, but we randomly assigned each respondent one of ten variants of the Facebook experiment.  We then asked follow-up questions.

\subsection{Recruiting and instructions}
We offered a Human Intelligence Task (HIT) on Mechanical Turk in which we presented prospective respondents with the offer in Figure~\ref{fig:offer}.

We presented participants who accepted the HIT with the following instructions:

\begin{packed_quotation}\footnotesize
Each of the following five pages will contain a description of a hypothetical scientific experiment, followed by questions about that experiment.
In order to answer the questions, please read the description of each experiment carefully.
\end{packed_quotation}
\subsection{Questions for each scenario}
We randomized the order of the experimental scenarios, but kept the ordering of questions and response options consistent.

The first question that followed the description of each scenario was one we designed to measure respondents' \emph{concern} for those participating in the experiment.  We asked: ``If someone you cared about were a candidate participant for this experiment, would you want that person to be included as a participant?''

We asked respondents about someone they care about, as opposed to themselves, because they might be more comfortable imagining others to be vulnerable and needing protection, whereas they might not want to admit being vulnerable themselves.  We provided the option to respond ``Yes'', ``I have no preference'', or ``No''.  We designed these options to be ordinal: from least concerned to most concerned.  We asked this concern question first in hopes that it would give respondents a chance to humanize potential participants and think about the consequences of the experiment on them.

We designed the second question to gauge whether respondents would disapprove of the experiment.  We asked, ``Do you believe the researchers should be allowed to proceed with this experiment?''  We offered four options, again ordered from most approving to least approving with the first option being ``Yes'' (on the left) and the last ``No'' (the fourth option, on the right).  We included the second option, ``Yes, but with caution'', for respondents who did not want to disapprove of a experiment but feared that an unambiguous ``yes'' would relieve researchers to their duty to take their ethical duties seriously.  The option in the third position from the left, between the two ``Yes'' options and ``No'', was ``I'm not sure.''  We treat this an ordinal value between the yes and the no options as the respondent is unable to commit to either and is therefore likely to be somewhere in between.

For each of the first two questions, we gave respondents a free-response field in which to explain their answers.

We also asked respondents ``Are you aware of having ever participated in such a study?'' and ``Are you aware of a study like this one having been performed by researchers in the past? (For example, have you have heard about it in the news or learned about it in a class?)''.  The answers options, from left to right, were ``Yes'' and ``No''.

\subsection{Closing questions}
After collecting respondents' responses to the five experimental scenarios, we asked the following questions about respondents' demographics and about factors that might influence their opinions:
%
\begin{packed_itemize}
\footnotesize
\item What year were you born?\\ (please use a four-digit year, or 'd' if you decline to answer)
\item
What is your gender?
\\  \{Male;Female;I'm uncomfortable answering\}
\item
What is your occupation?
\item
Have you ever purchased goods advertised via an unsolicited marketing email?
\\ \{Yes;No;I'm uncomfortable answering\}
\item
Have you ever participated in a study that involved deception?
\\ \{Yes; No; I'm uncomfortable answering\}
\item
Prior to participating in this study, had you heard about Facebook's `mood' study (the experiment that has the subject in many recent news stories).
\\ \{Yes; No\}
\end{packed_itemize}
%
We placed the question about prior knowledge of Facebook's experiment at the very end of our survey so as to avoid having this question taint responses to earlier questions.

\subsection{Payment}
We paid all respondents \$1 for the HIT regardless of their level of effort, answer quality, or time spent.  We also calculated a wage for each participant based on their time spent responding to the survey at an hourly wage of \$9.32 (the highest minimum wage of any state in the US), up to a maximum of \$3.11 for 20 minutes of time.  If the wage exceeded the \$1 paid for the HIT, we paid a bonus equal to the difference.  We paid bonuses after all surveys were complete---had we paid immediately and word spread, some respondents might have delayed completion.
